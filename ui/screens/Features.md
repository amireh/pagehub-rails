## Document organization: folders, spaces, and teams

Group up your documents within a - technically infinite -
hierarchy of folders that are presented to people in a
linked, Wiki-like way. [Read more](http://pagehub.org/pagehub/features/folders)
about folder support.

## Version control

Every edit you make to a page is tracked as a _revision_. You can use revisions
to restore a page to previous version without any hassle, or to track its 
change history.

## Group support

Aside of your own personal space of pages, you can create
groups where any number of people can collaboratively create,
edit, review, and share pages.

## Keybindings

Actions that you'll do regularly such as saving and
previewing can be quickly done using
[keybindings](http://www.pagehub.org/pagehub/keybindings).

## Customizable

PageHub offers several built-in themes for the rendered
versions of your pages. It also lets you customize things
like text justification, the page width, etc.

The editor is also customizable in its font face,
size, and line-height.

## Autosaving

Every 30 seconds as you're editing a page, PageHub will
automatically save it for you. It's even smart enough to
remember how you left each folder; collapsed or not.

## **Syntax highlighting**

Thanks to [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net) being awesome,
the editor supports real-time highlighting of the Markdown you
write as well as, to an extent, code written in other languages.

Rendered versions also include a syntax formatter and highlighter.

## Markdown Extensions

PageHub extends the Markdown syntax and renderer to provide you
with powerful utility features that will, hopefully, make the
documentation process a bit smoother.

The extensions include things like: dynamically embedding code snippets
(or fully-fledged pages) from GitHub (or anywhere), generating a
Table of Contents automatically for your lengthy articles,
injecting dynamic dates, etc.

## Open-Source

You can check out the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/amireh/pagehub) and host it on your own server or computer for maximum privacy.
